        <p>I regard myself as a person who is fascinated by challenges in all
sorts of way, work or life, that is merely based on my belief that
evolving and adapting to challenges is the whole concept of being
competitive and that is what i want to bring to the workplace. With
the less experience that i have only means i have more room for
improvement especially in programming languages, I have taught
myself a few and am willing to learn and be productive as a
software developer.
